## Workshop Overview

This hands-on workshop celebrates open data and mapping through an exploration of publically accessible portals and web services. We'll begin with an overview of open data, licensing, and use. Workshop participants will learn how to construct a basic web map using [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), the popular open-source JavaScript mapping library. We'll then practice requesting various data layers for integration with the map. The workshop will conclude with considerations for future steps for enhanced representation and interaction for mapping with open data.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

* identify sources for acquiring open data
* understand open data licenses and the implications for their use (non-profit/commercial, etc.)
* demonstrate the ability to build a basic web map using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (templates provided)
* access and retrieve open data layers and services using API keys and REST services
* request geospatial data stored as GeoJSON and add it to the map

## Expected background and requirements

This workshop is intended to be accessible to anyone interested in learning about open data and mapping (aka open to "newbies"). We expect no prior technical background and will demonstrate coding processes and provide examples and templates.

The workshop will provide computers for use, though you're encouraged to bring your own laptop if you wish. It is also recommended you create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you haven't already, as well as an account on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), prior to the workshop.
